White sauce pasta is something which almost 90% of kids and many adults also love to eat.

Pasta is a type of noodle thatâ€™s traditionally made from durum wheat, water or eggs. It is formed into different noodle shapes and then cooked in boiling water.

Nowadays, most products sold as pasta are made from common wheat. However, similar noodles can be made from other grains, such as rice, barley or buckwheat.

Some types of pasta are refined during processing, stripping the wheat kernel of the bran and germ, removing many of the nutrients.

Sometimes refined pasta is enriched, meaning it has some nutrients, such as B vitamins and iron, added back in.

Whole-grain pasta is also available, which contains all parts of the wheat kernel.



A few examples of commonly consumed types of pasta include:

Spaghetti
Tortellini
Ravioli
Penne
Fettuccine
Orzo
Macaroni

Common toppings for pasta include meat, sauce, cheese, vegetables and herbs.
